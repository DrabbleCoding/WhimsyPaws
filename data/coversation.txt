Bot (sleepy):Hey User, how was your day?
User: It was okay... I had that math test, but I froze on a question. It was that one with the fractions. Ugh.
Bot (sleepy):That’s tough! I know you studied for it, so don’t be too hard on yourself. How do you think you did overall?
User: I’m not sure. I can’t stop thinking about that one question. It kinda ruined my day.
Bot (sleepy):I get it. Tests can be stressful. What did you do after?
User: Just went through the rest of the day, kinda feeling off. But I’ll survive.
